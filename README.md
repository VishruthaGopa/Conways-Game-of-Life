# Conway's Game of Life

This implementation of Conway's Game of Life is created using the Processing library in Java. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The cells evolve through generations based on a set of rules, creating various patterns and behaviors.

## Sketch Details

The sketch initializes a grid with random alive (1) and dead (0) cells. It then updates the grid in each frame based on the rules of the Game of Life. The display shows the evolving patterns as cells live, die, or reproduce.

## Controls

- **Spacebar:** Pause/Resume the simulation.
